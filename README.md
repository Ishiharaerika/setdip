# setdip
An enso_ex plugin for DIP Switch Bit flipping on PSVita. Currently only support firmware 3.65.\
**Please DO NOT add it to taiconfig.txt.** If so hold L while boot to prevent custom plugin load.\
I'm aiming to support a wider range of firmware.\

You need to place libSceKblForKernel_365_stub.a at usr\local\vitasdk\arm-vita-eabi\lib for building.
